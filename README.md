Social lounge: focus on interaction with dogs & interaction with humans

It’s one thing to have a space to work & have your dog join you. But it’s another to have your dog there but have someone else doing the daycare for you. Ease of mind knowing they’re close & they’re getting attention but you’re just a few feet away. Maybe 2 way mirror so can observe dog without them seeing & worrying. Doggy door to get from play area to the hybrid working area?

Curated for your son/daughter. Not just a dog, use word best friend. Hand selected, niche, small client base

“Never feel guilty for leaving your baby at home by themselves”
“Productivity without the worrying”

Mission statement about my relationship to mousse & strong bond. Want to focus on work but able to watch them & also take breaks and go in room to play

High-class & boujee target audience wealthy young professionals who work from home. Vibe is point & feather, athletic club 

Play area for dogs
Workspace for humans
Clear glass to see dogs playing (like how gymkhana was set up)
Cubbies/lockers
Webcams (only accessible when present & only in doggy center) or just on tv monitors in the rooms 

Can pets also go into working space? 3 rooms. Only dogs, only work, hybrid of both. Sometimes need to focus so no distraction. “Quiet room” “social room” & some kind of hybrid working space 

Owners able to also go into play area whenever they want. Or maybe certain periods of the day everyone takes break from work & is allowed in like adult swim 

Lounge area: barista during day & bar for HH; pool, ping pong, darts, big reclining chairs with side table like library; couches, fireplace; on tap cold brew, kombucha, coffee

Dog trainers & constant care/hands on (dog lounge assistant/handler)
Ratio of 1 handler to X dogs
Must supervise, play, obedient train, feed, pick up poop, etc. for dogs

Meet & greet with on-site trainers 
Meet & greet with other dogs
Social interaction test with dogs (temperament, survey to fill out what they do/don’t like)
Social interaction test with humans (personality, work)
Referrals only 

Membership fee (plans for # of days or level of care?) silver/gold/platinum??

Indoor & outdoor (potty break??)
Weather appropriate (outdoor area for summer, indoors for winter)

NO overnight care
Only open during weekday working hours?
Guest passes for humans (1 or 2 a month?)

To do for dogs: fetching toys (balls, frisbees) ropes, squeakers, stuffed animals (monthly membership will help cover these costs), agility course, 

Keep track of dogs behaviors. If bad habits (destroying toys) then will charge per toy they destroy 

Maybe have daycare agenda? Feeding times, activities, potty breaks, nap time/nap room
